## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" target="_blank">Reverse Polish Notation</a>.

Evaluate the expression. Return *an integer that represents the value of the expression*.

Note that:

	
- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
	
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
	
- The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
	
- There will not be any division by zero.
	
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
	
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`
>**Output**: `9`
>**Explanation**: `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`
>**Output**: `6`
>**Explanation**: `(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`
>**Output**: `22`
>**Explanation**: `((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
>= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
>= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
>= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
>= (0 + 17) + 5
>= 17 + 5
>= 22
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4`
>
>- `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

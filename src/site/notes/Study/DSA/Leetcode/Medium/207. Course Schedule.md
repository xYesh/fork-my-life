## Problem Statement
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]` indicates that you must take course `b<sub>i</sub>` first if you want to take course `a<sub>i</sub>`.

	
- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
>**Output**: `true`
>**Explanation**: `There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
>`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]`
>**Output**: `false`
>**Explanation**: `There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
>`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
>
>- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
>
>- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
>
>- `0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses`
>
>- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

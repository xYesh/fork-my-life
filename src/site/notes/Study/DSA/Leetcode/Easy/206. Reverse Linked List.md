## Problem Statement
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.

>Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Relevant Concepts
- 

## Approach
- You take a recursive approach.
	- `ListNode next = reverseList(head.next);` This returns what your next node is.
		- When going in reverse, That next node needs to be returned to your previous node. That's why we're returning it. 
	- `head.next.next = head;` We are pointing the `next` of your `next` to yourself.
	- `head.next = null;` We are setting your next to null so that it doesn't cause a cycle. 
## Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }

        ListNode next = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: `o(n)` as it depends on the size of the list.
- Space complexity:  `o(n)` as the size of the stack is the size of the list.

## Reflections
- Take another look at the approach and truly understand what is happening.

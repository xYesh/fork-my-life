- [ ] Reverse Linked List  [link](https://ticktick.com/webapp/#p/674f4562ebbe1a00000002b9/tasks/674f4615d10f53100c71b7a2) 

## Problem Statement
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return *the reversed list*.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1

>
>**Input**: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`
>**Output**: `[5,4,3,2,1]
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)
>
>**Input**: `head = [1,2]`
>**Output**: `[2,1]
`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `head = []`
>**Output**: `[]
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
>
>- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

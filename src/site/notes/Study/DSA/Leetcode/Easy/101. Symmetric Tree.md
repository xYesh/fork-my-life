- [x] Symmetric Tree  [link](https://ticktick.com/webapp/#p/674f4562ebbe1a00000002b9/tasks/674fb92a00abe8302ce4a8a4) #ticktick   âœ… 2024-12-04

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *check whether it is a mirror of itself* (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1

>
>**Input**: `root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]`
>**Output**: `true
`

>
>**Input**: `root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]`
>**Output**: `false
`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
>
>- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Relevant Concepts
- [[Study/DSA/Algorithms/BFS\|BFS]]

## Approach
- Do a BFS approach and compare the entire queue at the beginning of every level.
	- This leads to a space complexity of `o(b)` where b is the widest level ? Need to check on this logic
## Solution
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            ArrayList<TreeNode> list = new ArrayList<>(queue);
            int pointer = list.size() - 1;
            int i = 0;

            while (pointer != i && pointer > i) {
                int left = list.get(i) == null ? -101 : list.get(i).val;
                int right = list.get(pointer) == null ? -101 : list.get(pointer).val;
                i++;
                pointer--;
                if (left != right) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            
            int breadth = list.size();
            for (int j=0; j<breadth; j++) {
                TreeNode popped = queue.poll();
                if (popped == null) {
                    continue;
                }
                TreeNode left = popped.left;
                TreeNode right = popped.right;
                queue.add(left);
                queue.add(right);
            }
        }

        return true;

    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity:
- Space complexity:

## Reflections
- We can do a recursive or iterative approach just comparing two values at a time instead of doing the entire level at a time.
	- This looks a lot more cleaner to look at.
	- It also reduces the space complexity

Official benchmarking docs - [ClickBench — a Benchmark For Analytical DBMS](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/)  

- It has comparisons to Pinot too.
# Objective

Build a performance tool to simulate high volume read operations on trace data specifically targeting a QPS of  100.

---
# Functional Requirements

**Ability to configure test load scenarios, including:**
1. Target data(traces, logs, metrics)
2. Target  data store (ClickHouse, Pinot, Victoria Logs,etc)
3. Query types (e.g., primary key/value search, secondary key/value search, time-series queries, text search )
4. Load parameters (number of concurrent users, ramp-up time, duration)

**Executing Performance test plan:**
1. Execute predefined test scenarios.
2. Generate and send test traffic (queries) to the target hot store(CH/Pinot/VL/etc).
3. Monitor and record performance metrics (e.g., response time, throughput, error rate).

# Non - Functional Requirements
1. **Maintainability: P2**
2. Modular and well-structured codebase.
3. Easy to update and extend for new hot stores or test scenarios.
4. Generate target QPS of 100.

# Available Solutions

## Clickhouse-benchmark

doc - [https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-benchmark](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/utilities/clickhouse-benchmark)

### Pros
- Official benchmark tool used by Clickhouse
- Provides out of the box statistics like
    - QPS, RPS (rows read per second), MiB/s, Results per second, Percentile of query execution times.
- Provides several parameters like 
    - Number of concurrent queries. 
    - Randomize the input queries. 
    - Number of iterations. 

### Cons
- Input is a file containing all the queries that need to be run. 
    - **Need to write a script that will generates the input file based on some parameters**
- Queries cannot contain placeholders that can be replaced during runtime. 
- cannot have categories of queries, just one large list. 

  

## Python Script to Query Directly Using Clickhouse-cli

doc - [https://github.com/ClickHouse/simple-logging-benchmark](https://github.com/ClickHouse/simple-logging-benchmark)

### Pros
- Custom written script, we can easily have placeholders and other items in the query list that can be replaced during runtime. 

### Cons
- **Custom written script.** 
- Need to ensure it is stable and need to calculate all the stats and ensure accuracy. 

  

## K6 Script - Query via the Clickhouse HTTP Port

doc - Clickhouse HTTP interface - [https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/http](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/http)

### Pros
- K6 script is an industry standard and we have some familiarity with it. 
- We can store the queries as templates and easily generate queries based on config.
- **Script can be re-used for testing other Datastores.**

### Cons
- The scripts need to be written manually.
- **Prod servers might use the official plugin which uses the TCP port to communicate**
